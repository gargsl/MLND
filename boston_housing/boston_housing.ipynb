In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "2. LSTAT - I would expect that a low LSTAT value neighborhood will have higher MEDV. A \"lower class\" homeowner would not be able to afford an expensive house.

    "\n",
    "3. PTRATIO - Assuming that a low students to teacher ratio means better school, a neighborhood with low PTRATIO will likely have higher MEDV as demand for houses in a neighborhood with better school will likely be higher and will drive the prices up."

    "For the graph with max_depth = 10, as more training points are added, the score of the testing curve increases initially but doesn't improve after around 200 data points. The training curve score is very high and remains almost constant as more training points are added. There is a considerable difference between training score and testing score at any given data point. The high performance which we see during training is not seen during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph, it is evident that adding more training points will not really benefit the model here. The model most probably suffers from overfitting and is not performing well on unseen test dataset during testing. Adding more training data points is not going to help improve the testing score."

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model suffer from high bias. As seen in the complexity curves graph, both the traning and validation score is very low for max_depth = 1. The score is lowest for any part of the curve. This indicates that model is bias towards certain features and is underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10, the model suffer from high variance. Validation score gets better as the maximum depth is increased but beyond maximum depth of 3 to 4, the validation score remains almost the same (and even lowers a bit) while the training score kepps getting better. As the maximum depth is increased, the difference between training score and validation score keeps getting bigger with biggest difference for max depth of 10. The model is suffering from high variance at this point likely because of heavy overfitting (perfect validation score)."

Of the k subsets of the the training data, (k-1) subsets are then used for training of the model and the remaining single subset is used as the validation data for validation of the model. This process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsets used exactly once as the validation data. The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the k iterations. \n",

Using k-fold CV, there is no specific test set and model will not overfit on the preselected test set. Each data point is used for validation exactly once.\n",

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
